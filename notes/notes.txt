Animation Problem

GOAL: AVOID HAVING SEPARATE FUNCTIONS TO ANIMATE PLAYER VERSUS ENEMIES AND OTHER MOVABLE OBJECTS

option #1: store pointers to animation sets directly on each movable / player with common label e.g. ME_UP, ME_DOWN, etc. 
this will increase the size of each movable a lot as more animation sets are added, so probably wont scale well

option #2: store an absolute offset from animdefs start on each movable / player. 
this is essentially the same as storing a pointer on each object but you save a byte.

option #3: store a base + relative offset on each movable / player without a pointer table. 
this requires the various animation sets to be laid out in a common order AND size. 
(eg PLAYER U 3 frames, D 3 frames ... ENEMY U 3 frames, D 3 frames ...)

option #4: store a base + relative offset on each movable / player with a pointer table. 
this requires animation sets to share a common order, but size can be variable. 
(eg PLAYER U 3 frames, D 3 frames ... ENEMY U 2 frames, D 2 frames ... )

I AM GOING WITH OPTION #4 FOR NOW


Layout Example

-shared.h-
ME_ANIMOFF_WALKU = 0,
ME_ANIMOFF_WALKD = 2,
ME_ANIMOFF_WALKL = 4,
ME_ANIMOFF_WALKR = 6,

ANIMBASE: Player = 0xnnnn
ANIMBASE: Enemey = 0xnnnn
etc

to access:
Player+ME_ANIMOFF_WALKU
Enemy+ME_ANIMOFF_WALKU
